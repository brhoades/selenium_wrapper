       Reporting can be disabled by excluding the report option from the kwargs of :func:`main`. This has the

       Other options include a id="" option which allows you to specify a custom computer ID. Similarly, including run="" allows
       you to choose a specific run to join. Note that the run will be created if it doesn't already exist and will be used for 
       all subsequent script calls until removed.
