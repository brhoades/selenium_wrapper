class ElementCache:
    """Creates an object to store WebDriver elements on specific pages so subsequent lookups do not require scanning the DOM. 

    A great deal of time on some pages is spent looking for elements which have already been found. If the page does not change,
    any previously used element link will be valid (barring changed CSS). ElementCache wraps a hash table which uses the URL with
    element name and type for a key to point to a :py:class:`~selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement.WebElement`. This is in turn used 
    for every call to :func:`~sw.utils.exists` before searching for the element (via :func:`get`), as the hash lookup is nearly free compared
    to a page search. 

    self.cache is, as mentioned above, a hash. The hash takes the following format::

        { 
            "<URL where elements are valid>" => {
                "<element identifying characteristic>_<identifying field>" => [ <expiration unix timestamp, if any>, <`WebElement` reference to loginbutton> ],
                [...]

            },
            [...]
        }
    
    A mock example::
    
        { 
            "http://website.com/pageiamon.html" => {
                "loginbutton_id" => [ 1416592420, <`WebElement` reference to loginbutton> ],
                "banner_name"    => [ None,       <`WebElement` reference to banner> ],
                [...]

            },
            [...]
        }
                
    
    self.cache is effectively a double hash that points to an array. Checks are performed on the element before returned, so an invalid or expired element
    should never be returned. At the end of every run the owning :py:class:`~sw.child.Child` object manually clears the ElementCache as, for almost all test cases,
    the elements will be long expired.
